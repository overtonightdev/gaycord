**FreaxCord** is a vaporwave-inspired Discord client mod by **matthew (unfamiliardev)**. It is a rebrand and reskin of
[Equicord](https://github.com/Equicord/Equicord), which is itself an enhanced fork of
[Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord) bundling 300+ community plugins.

## Installing FreaxCord

### Build from source

Works on **Windows**, **macOS**, **Linux** and **BSD** — anything with Git, Node and the Discord desktop app. `pnpm inject` auto-detects your Discord install (Stable/PTB/Canary/Dev, including `/opt`, distro packages, `~/.local`, BSD `/usr/local`, Flatpak and Snap layouts).

### Dependencies

[Git](https://git-scm.com/download) and [Node.JS LTS](https://nodejs.dev/en/) are required.

Install `pnpm`:

> :exclamation: This next command may need to be run as admin/root depending on your system, and you may need to close and reopen your terminal for pnpm to be in your PATH.

```shell
npm i -g pnpm
```

> :exclamation: **IMPORTANT** Make sure you aren't using an admin/root terminal from here onwards. It **will** mess up your Discord/FreaxCord instance and you **will** most likely have to reinstall.

Clone FreaxCord:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/unfamiliardev/FreaxCord
cd FreaxCord
```

Install dependencies:

```shell
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

Build FreaxCord:

```shell
pnpm build
```

Inject FreaxCord into your desktop client:

```shell
pnpm inject
```

Build FreaxCord for web:

```shell
pnpm buildWeb
```

After building FreaxCord's web extension, locate the appropriate ZIP file in the `dist` directory and follow your browser's guide for installing custom extensions, if supported.

Note: Firefox extension zip requires Firefox for developers

<details>
<summary>Using FreaxCord violates Discord's terms of service</summary>

Client modifications are against Discord's Terms of Service.

However, Discord is pretty indifferent about them and there are no known cases of users getting banned for using client mods! So you should generally be fine if you don't use plugins that implement abusive behaviour. But no worries, all inbuilt plugins are safe to use!

Regardless, if your account is essential to you and getting disabled would be a disaster for you, you should probably not use any client mods (not exclusive to FreaxCord), just to be safe.

Additionally, make sure not to post screenshots with FreaxCord in a server where you might get banned for it.
